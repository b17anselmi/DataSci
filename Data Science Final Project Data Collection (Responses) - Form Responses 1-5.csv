I appreciate that this survey is trying to identify people's definitions of AI, but I would expand that slightly - the issue of what intelligence is, artificial or not, is up to enough debate that discussions of AI often lead to talking past each other by not referring to the same thing.  I believe the term AI has been associated with vague and unachievable goals, and that as soon as someone sets a specific definitio, it's often been very easy to come up with something that would satisfy that definition strictly yet not be considered 'intelligent' in general discussion, leading to perpetually moving goalposts.  (Similarly, defitions for ""life"" suffer the same problem.)  That said, some specific tasks have very impressive solutions in software.  R&D has certainly been more effective on specific solutions to specific problems, and the recent round of AI research seems to have recognized this is a better way to maintain funding than to attempt to work on 'intelligence' in the abstract.  Stepping back further, human cognition has a lot of quirks - we're not logical, but in somewhat systematic ways, and we take debatably-valuable shortcuts in reasoning.  Depending on the problem one is trying to solve, simulating *human* intelligence could easily be a flawed approach.
